The Mockingbird Data Environment provides a dynamic data processing engine for iOS applications that allows arbitrary data models and object graphs to be stored in a *variable space* from which values can be extracted using *expressions*.

[The MBDataEnvironment project documentation](https://github.com/emaloney/MBDataEnvironment/blob/master/README.md) on GitHub provides a high-level overview of how to use the Mockingbird Data Environment in your application.

Documentation for the public API appears below.
